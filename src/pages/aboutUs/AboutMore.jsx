          We are an emerging e-commerce platform in Nepal. Launched to seize the
          prospects in the barrier. It was on April 2023 - 3rd day after the
          lockdown imposed by the government of Nepal.

          industry of Nepal. Offers a wide range of products from groceries to
          automobiles, clothing to accessories, and so on. We came into being
          not just to sell, but to bring reform to the culture of e-commerce in

          <li>
            Settling payments to vendors within 3-4 days, which sometimes take
            months with other e-commerce companies.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          We are risk-takers and believe in taking on challenges to turn them
          into opportunities. Our ultimate goal is to become a global brand and
          create job opportunities while promoting local enterprises. We
          understand that vulnerability is a part of the process, but our
